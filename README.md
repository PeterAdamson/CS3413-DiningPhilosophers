# CS3413-DiningPhilosophers
A multithreaded c program that solves the dining philosophers problem.  A philosopher must have two chopsticks in order to eat.  There are chopsticks on the left and right of each philosopher (e.g. the chopsticks will have to be shared).  This program schedules the philosophers to solve the problem so that none of them go hungry.
